We are a family-led initiative that supports a small number of high-impact charitable [projects](charities.md) through a trustee-led network. We focus on ecology, education, and social good, guided by a commitment to ethical governance and long-term relationships.

The Foundation ensures transparency in its funding decisions and provides feedback to the initiatives supported.
